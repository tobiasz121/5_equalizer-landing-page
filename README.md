# Frontend Mentor - Equalizer landing page solution

This is a solution to the [Equalizer landing page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/equalizer-landing-page-7VJ4gp3DE). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 





## Overview
During this challenge, the vast majority of time I was struggling with responsive design and adjusting page to the media screen size using media queries. It is one 
of my first tries at that, so lots of room for improvements. 

For changing colors of the images I used 'filter' option for the first time. With mixing the effects I was able to get the desired color.
